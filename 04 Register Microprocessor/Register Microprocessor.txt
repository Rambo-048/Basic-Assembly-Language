3. Register INTEL 8086
   - Register --> Memory inside Processor (characteristic not Permanent)         
       
   1. General Purpose Register
      1. AX (Acumulator Register)  -> When the microprocessor performs any arithmetic or logical operations, 
                                   the accumulator provides one of the operands 
                                   and it also holds the result of the operation. 
      2. BX (Base Register)        -> Reading Data from Memory or Writing data into memory 
      3. CX (Counter Register)     -> In rotate and shift instructions, register CL is used as 8 bit counter, 
                                   it used to store 8-bit count. In some instructions like REP (repeat), 
                                   Loop, register CX is used as 16-bit implicit counter.
      4. DX (Address Register)     -> Create Address for Input/Output
   
   
   2. Pointers
      1. Stack Pointer             -> It is used to hold the address of the stack top. 
      				      Stack top is the uppermost filled memory location in stack memory. 
      				      There is no access to these register directly, 
      				      the modifications are done depending on the contents of the stack.
       
      2. Base Pointer              -> The use of BP as a pointer to a memory location is similar to the use of SI and DI registers. 
                                      BP register acts as a memory pointer to the stack segment register. 
                                      The BP register is mainly used to access any location directly in the stack.
       
   3. Index Register
      1. Destination Index         -> Store Data
      2. Source Index              -> microprocessor will take the effective address of the data.
      
      -- Take the address of the data from SI and store it in DI --
   
   4. Segment Register
      1. Code Segment              -> It is used to point to the base address of the code segment.
      2. Data Segment              -> It is used to point to the base address of the data segment.
      3. Stack Segment             -> This register is used to store the base address of the stack memory segment.
      4. Extra Segment             -> This register is used to store the base address of the extra memory segment.
    
   5. Instruction Pointer          -> The IP gives the offset address of the next instruction to be executed, 
                                      IP stores the address of the next instruction to be fetched from the code segment. 
                                      When reset is activated, the instruction pointer is 
                                      set to the address of the first instruction to be fetched.
   6. Flags --> Function Flag Save Value From ALU 
                that indicates the current state of the execution 
                of arithmetic or logical instruction in the processor.
                
      1. Carry Flag (CF)
      2. Parity Flag (PF)
      3. Auxiliary Carry Flag (AF)
      4. Zero Flag (ZF)
      5. Sign Flag (SF)
      6. Overflow Flag (OF)
      7. Interupt Flag (IF)
      8. Trap Flag (TF)
      9. Directional Flag (DF)
